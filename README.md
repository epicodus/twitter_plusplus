Twitter++
=====
*Twitter, with (1) more character*

##Description
This aims to be a functioning clone of Twitter. It will be better than the real thing.
"How is that possible!?", you ask. "Twitter is amazing, you can't out-do them."
Here's my secret: This version of twitter allows you to send 141 character tweets.
This is *impossible* with the original twitter! They only go to 140!
Clearly, this will be a superior implementation of a good idea.

Needless to say this is a work in progress. This readme, and the project as a whole.

Eventually this will have more interesting stuff that tells you how to run this app and use it and etc.

But for now, consider this a dummy placeholder.
